    "The **Monostate** is a variation of the Singleton pattern that consists of putting all the state of an object into a static variable, but at the same time creating new objects is allowed; all of these new instances will all access the same state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will create a `CEO` class. Most companies have a single CEO; we will allow them to call the initializer and construct a CEO however many times they want, but every single instance will be referring to the same CEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this, our class will have a static variable (the shared state for all objects), and our initializer will assign this state to `__dict__`, a special attribute of every single object in Python that stores the object's writable attributes."

    "1. We create a new object by calling the `__new__` method of the superclass. Because we're currently overriding `__new__`, we cannot do something like `super().__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)` because we do not have an implicit `__class__` variable at this stage (needed for the zero-argument version of `super`), so we use the 2-argument form of `super` instead: the first argument is the class where the method is being defined, and the second is the actual class passed into `__new__`.\n",

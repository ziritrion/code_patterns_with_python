    "    * In Python, it's a common convention to end a variable name with an underscore if there is a risk of conflict with keywords or built-in names or functions, so the class argument is called `class_`.\n",
    "2. We will keep a dictionary of singleton classes, so that we can keep track of any and all singletons.\n",
    "3. The actual workings of the decorator are defined in an \"inner\" function, which in our case it's called `get_instance`. This inner function does the actual job...\n",
    "4. ...and then, the \"outer\" function (the decorator) simply returns the inner function (but does not call it! It simply returns the function object).\n",
    "5. Our inner function simply checks whether our `instances` dictionary already contains an instance of the class or not; if false, it instantiates the class and adds it to the dictionary and returns the instance, and if true, it simply looks up the instance in the dictionary and returns it.\n",

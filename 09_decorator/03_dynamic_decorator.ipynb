    "\n",
    "What we are going to do however is treat the class as if it were a file: our class should mimic the behavior of a file, and we will add the logging capabilities additionally. For simplicity, we will only implement a single file method ([`writelines`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_file_writelines.asp)), but you can use your imagination for the rest. Our implementation will simply call the original `writelines` method and add some logging.\n",

    "However, we still want our class to behave like a file, which means that we would have to implement every single file method. Instead, we will redirect all attribute requests to the underlying file within our class by overriding `__getattr__`, `__setattr__` and `__delattr__`."

    "Here's what's happening in the code above:\n",
    "* `__getattr__` is the getter: we simply call `getattr` with the file object and the attribute we want to recover from it.\n",
    "* `__setattr__` is the setter: here we actually want to check whether we're trying to change the handle of the file (thereby replacing the file itself) or we're trying to modify a specific attribute within the file.\n",
    "* `__delattr__` is the deleter: we simply call `delattr` with the file object and the attribute we want to delete.\n",
    "* Both `__iter__` and `__next__` are used to make our file both iterable and an iterator, which is required for files. However, we can access both of these methods from `__getattr__`, so it's not necessary to implement them.\n",

    "By implementing these 3 methods, we can access every single attribute and method of our file, thus saving us a lot of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an additional note, you might recall that `__dict__` is a special attribute that all Python objects contain. Accessing `self.__dict__['file']` is identical to accessing `self.file` in most cases, but since we're overriding the getter, setter and deleter, we have to be very careful with some specific side effects:\n",
    "* `self.file = value` is syntactic sugar for `self.__setattr__('file', value)`. If we try to replace line 15 with the simplified `self.file = value`, we would cause infinite recursion because we'd keep calling `__setattr__` recursively. The current line bypasses calling `__setattr__`.\n",
    "* The line 11 could be simplified with `getattr(self.file, item)` but only because we're initializing our objext with a file; if `self.file` did not exist, it would cause another infinite recursion scenario because Python would try to call `__getattr__('file')` if it could not find `self.file`, which would trigget another `getattr(self.file, item)`, and so on. `getattr(self.__dict__['file'], item)` bypasses calling `__getattr__`; if Python doesn't find `__dict__['file']` it would simply raise a KeyError.\n",
    "* The issues above do not affect `__delattr__`, so we include a simplified version for easier reading.\n",

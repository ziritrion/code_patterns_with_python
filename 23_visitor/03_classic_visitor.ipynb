    "This is called **double dispatch** because there are 2 objects that determine the method that gets called. In our example, `Expression.accept(visitor)` calls a method but what method exactly depends on `Expression` (which could be either `DoubleExpression` or `AdditionExpression`), and `visitor` (`ExpressionPrinter`) contains the behavior. We can create additional expressions such as subtraction and we could create additional visitors like for evaluating expressions, and the combination of the two parts would decide the correct code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we still need to take care of the `visit` overwriting issue within `ExpressionPrinter`. The easiest way to deal with this would be to rename each `visit` method to something different for each expression type and then override the `accept` method within each expression class to call the appropiate method, but what we will do instead is create a **decorator** that we can use to differentiate each `visit` method inside `ExpressionPrinter`."
